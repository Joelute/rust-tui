Hmm, it's October 29th.
That's the start of the Great Depression in 1928.
Well that's depressing...
But it was also the day when a little baby was born.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY JEFF!!!
What, you thought I forgot? How dare you to think so.
Anyways it's your special day and I hope you're able to celebrate it.
Thank you for being an integral part of our little friend group.
You will, and always be our favourite 10x engineer.
Happy birthday.
